# Restaurant order menu - scrimba project

### In this soloproject we had to meet the following requirements:
- follow the Figma design spec
- render the menu options using JavaScript
- enable the option to add and remove items
- have a payment modal with compulsory form inputs


### What I´ve learned while building this project
- how to push new items to an array and render the outcome according to the design spec
- dynamically asign unique uuid´s to newly added items
- to remove a selected item from the array by getting the index of the item first. Although the list of added items in a real world restaurant app wouldn´t look like 
this, it´s a great excercise to truely understand the logic behind each user action.

### Future adjustments  

- make it fully responsive
- change the theme
- offer a 'meal deal' discount
- allow users to rate their experience
